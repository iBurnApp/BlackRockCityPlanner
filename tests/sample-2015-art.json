In the center (the heart of the heart), dwells a geometric jungle gym, that rotates under human power, while the 3-tier base supports the structure with minimal \r\nimpact to the Playa (no holes!). METAHEART is about discovery. Exploration reveals different aspects of the geometry, as the shape appears to change depending on \r\nthe viewpoint. Interaction brings the sculpture to life, as its sub-powered heartbeat keeps pace with its rotating centerpiece. At night there is more to discovered.Computer-driven LEDs pulsate to the beat, and 3 red lasers, each at a 33 degree angle atop the sculpture, sweep in synchronization. A next level of audio-reactive \r\nlight shows is unlocked only by the proximity of a sufficiently loud art car.",

Solar powered, touch sensitive pads will be placed throughout the frame. As people interact with the frame, the sound and lighting activate, encouraging contact, imagination and exploration. \r\n\r\nThis piece is in honor of my Abuela, Rosamelia, and is an opportunity to acknowledge the incredible support that I am so grateful to have had growing up and to pass it on. To inspire self expression, to call up the performer, the artist, the brown sheep and the nut. I imagine the joy that will happen as a result of Got Framed to be a mirror of her gifts to us.",

    "description": "Pinea Arbori is a sculpture that investigates the energies in the brains of beings. In particular the piece is a representation of a pineal gland enclosed in a mutant brain like tree. The piece studies the energies of the brain and through the use of automation, a Tesla coil, the activation of the Pineal Gland and the opening of the Third Eye. Through this expression, Pinea Arbori is meant to generate conversation on the energies of the universe as well as those inside our own brains.",

    "description": "Include the Cleu seeks to provide a moment to fully experience what it means to be a conscious being on planet Earth. The labyrinth provides a contemplative experience on the playa, a special place where participants can take as long as they like to walk individually or with others on the intertwining circular paths representing the miraculous synchronicities of Consciousness, Life, Earth, Universe. The swirling colors and sounds of the playa just beyond the colorful paths and flags of the labyrinth make a backdrop for the fascinating panoply of creativity on the playa. Within the labyrinth, participants find a calm center, a space for musing and meditation, or a peaceful moment of At-Onement. In a magical box at the base of a large Cleu, participants may find a clue to their own lives or even be led to CleuCamp where they can get a Cleu brainwashing and copper Cleu pendant. Like the rube at a carnival, Include the Cleu simply offers a fresh perspective, inspiring wonder and delight.",
